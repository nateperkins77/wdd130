        Overview:
        Star Wars is the epitome of adventure. It’s the struggle between right and wrong, 
        light and darkness, good and evil. Packed with epic characters, unique alien species,
         and mystical powers, Star Wars contains much more substance than your typical sci-fi flick.
        The stories found within Star Wars illustrate powerful motifs, mesmerizing visuals, and 
        incredible moral conflicts. The lessons taught by Star Wars will last a lifetime, and the 
        characters are worth looking up to. This website will focus primarily on Star Wars movies, 
        but there is so much more out there for those willing to dive a little deeper.

        Purpose:
        Galaxy Guide was created to help new fans of Star Wars to learn about the world, 
        the characters, and even the timeline of events. Designed for fans new and old alike, 
        Galaxy Guide will help you “Explore the stories, characters, and lore of a galaxy far, 
        far away”. From summaries to deep dives to my own personal opinions, use Galaxy Guide 
        as a partner as you begin or continue your journey across the stars.
